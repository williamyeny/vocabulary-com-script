#Summary
Any actions executed client-side instead of sending server-side can be manipulated. Vocabulary.com is a perfect example of this. This script simply reads hidden answers sent by the server and sends it right back.

#Dependencies
Mechanize
```
gem install mechanize
```
Caesar Cipher (because I was too lazy to write it myself)
```
gem install caesar_cipher
```

#Files?
vocab-source is just Javascript taken directly off Vocabulary.com's website.
devlog.txt is just a journal of sorts.
