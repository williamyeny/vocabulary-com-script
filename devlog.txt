Answers are checked client-side; disconnected internet and it would still validate

First, gotta load cookies into mechanize to "log in"

Looked into Javascript client code, found a section that referenced a JSON field with the answers

Viewed activity in dev tools. One post request called "nextQuestion" seemed to retrieve the questions answers

Went to POST url in Chrome, generated a JSON

Found out that "adata" field was an encoded string with nonce ID's

Used Mechanize to POST nextQuestion and retrieve the file

Converted file to string to JSON and parsed it

Viewed the Javascript client code again, and took the field and decoded "adata" with Base64

adata was "encrypted" with a simple caeser cipher that shifted each letter 13 spaces to the right

Couldn't figure out why I couldn't post "SaveAnswer" to submit the answer, found out it was because the "secret" had to be identical to the "nextQuestion" "secret".

Dug a bit more and discovered that it was more advanced: SaveAnswer's reponse secret had to equal NextQuestion's post fields and NextQuestion's reponse secret had to equal SaveAnswer's post fields

Needed to extract first index in adata hash, problem was adata hash was in string form

Used a method to take a string between two other strings to extract data

Found out there's more than one problem; one regular answer and one "master" question

Checked the question type by seeing if the first letter was either "n" for "nonce" or "a" for "acceptedAnswers"

Used the same method to take a string between two other strings (first was "word:\"") for the "master" question

Experimented with "t", which stood for milliseconds since epoch, probably meant to calculate game time

Pretty much confirmed "t" will not affect answering questions, even though it is a field in the POST request (however does affect "play time" on profile)

When running, script would crash whenever you completed a new section, possibly since it can't find the JSON values in a new section slide

Fixed this with simple exception handling (lol hacky)
